1.8: Create a branch
Now that you only have one main branch in your repo, create a branch from main. The branch you want to create should be called feature/ followed by the first letter of your first name and then your surname in lower case (no spaces or accents in the name).

Ex Albus Dumbledore --> feature/adumbledore

Then go to your newly created feature/{name} branch.

⚠️ ANSWER: Create a file called 1.8 containing the commands you used to create it, and move to the new branch.
